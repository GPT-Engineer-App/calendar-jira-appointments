# calendar-jira-appointments

an app that displays in a web page my calendar (based on outlook) and the JIRA tickets that are assign to me. I want to be able to drag and drop the JIRA tickets to the calendar and it should create a new appointment from based on the story points. Assume 1 story point is 30 minutes of work. If the task is longer than 2 hours, break the JIRA ticket into multiple appointments so that the longest duration is 2 hours, and suffix the appointments with - PART 1, 2 etc.
